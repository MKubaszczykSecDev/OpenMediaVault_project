# OpenMediaVault_project
Raspberry Pi 3 NAS running OpenMediaVault. My first home server project, with a roadmap to implement Docker and API-driven performance monitoring.

Description of project:
Deployed a NAS solution using my Raspberry PI 3 and OpenMediaVault which is a user-friendly, Debian-based platform ideal for my first home server project. This documentation chronicles the foundational steps of transforming a single-board computer into a Network-Attached Storage device, focusing on core setup, file sharing (SMB), and basic system health. Future plans for this project include leveraging OMV's capabilities to implement Docker containers for android users to be able to access the NAS and developing API scripts to visualize storage utilization and system performance.

Note:
First time using GitHub, apologies in advance for any inconsistancies or if I cause confusion. :)
