These are the projects i am planning to do in the near future, these will be an addition to the currently completed project (1).


1) Harden the Foundation (Completed)
    Value Summary: I completed the initial setup to establish least-privilege access and secure storage. This ensures my server is protected from the start by enforcing strong, password-required authentication and securing data in transit with Transport Encryption.

2) Storage Utilization Monitor (Python API): I will develop a custom Python script using the OMV API to retrieve storage metrics. This demonstrates my ability to implement automated system monitoring, which is critical for predictive maintenance and ensuring the NAS remains available.

2) Implement Containerization and Universal Access
    Docker & Portainer: I will install Docker and Portainer because using containers is the most professional and secure way to deploy new services. This ensures that every new application is isolated, improving system stability and preventing potential security breaches in the core OS.

    Universal Upload Gateway (FileBrowser): I will deploy a web-based file manager to provide a secure HTTP/HTTPS upload interface accessible via any smartphone browser. This improves usability and compatibility for Android/iOS users who struggle with native network file access.

4) Deploy Security & Monitoring Tools
    Network Filtering (Pi-Hole): I will deploy Pi-Hole to act as a network-wide security filter. This instantly improves my network's security posture by blocking known malware, phishing, and tracking domains at the perimeter level.

    Vulnerability Monitoring (Watchtower): I will deploy Watchtower to continuously monitor and update all running containers. This ensures my server is protected from known vulnerabilities by implementing automated patch management.

5) Advanced Backup & Recovery Strategy

    Backup & Recovery Plan: I will configure remote synchronization and a full recovery plan. This demonstrates a focus on Data Integrity (I) and Availability (A), ensuring the project meets professional standards for resilience against data loss or corruption.
